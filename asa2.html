<h3>How is data on the intenet stored and transported?</h3>
<p>The internet is stored in large data warehouses as well as people's hard drives.<br/>

When some people hear the word internet, it is assumed that it's all stored online somewhere in the cloud, which is a true fact. When you access the internet, you're then pulling the data for that specific query(e.g accessing a website/watching a video) from physical hard drives located all around the world.<br/>

The data warehouses, where a lot of this data is stored and where websites are hosted are highly secured. Sometimes even hidden. Some data warehouses are located in the middle of the desert, which makes that data very hard to physically access.</p>

<p>Data travels across the internet in packets. Each packet can carry a maximum of 1,500 bytes. Around these packets is a wrapper with a header and a footer. The information contained in the wrapper tells computers what kind of data is in the packet, how it fits together with other data, where the data came from and the data's final destination.</p>

<h3>How does a search engine work?</h3>
<p>A search engine makes an index using a program called a ‘web crawler’. This automatically browses the web and stores information about the pages it visits.</br>

The information that the web crawler puts together is then used by search engines. It becomes the search engine’s index. Every webpage recommended by a search engine has been visited by a web crawler.</p>
